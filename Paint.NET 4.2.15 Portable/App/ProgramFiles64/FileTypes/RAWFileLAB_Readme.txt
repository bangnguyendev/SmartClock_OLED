A dcraw based RAWFile plugin with an advanced GUI.

After a raw image is loaded in paint.net, metadata and parameters used by dcraw are captured and saved to an xml file. White balance multipliers, darkness, and saturation are transferred back to the GUI, creating an efficient workflow for raw conversion experimenting. The GUI also shows the metadata output from dcraw for the last image loaded in paint.net.
-----

Usage

The RAWFile LAB GUI will appear when you open a RAW image, if not already open. After adjusting parameters, you may either hit Reopen to open the image in paint.net with the new parameters, or go and reopen it directly in paint.net.
